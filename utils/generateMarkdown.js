  ## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

\`\`\`sh
${data.installation} https://github.com/andersonasprilla/README.md-Generator.git
\`\`\`


## Usage
  
  Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
  
  To add a screenshot, create an assets/images folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
  
      md
      ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
      
  
  ## License
  
  The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
  
  ## Contribution
  
  If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
  
  ## Tests
  
  Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
